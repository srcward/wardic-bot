## Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how the bot ("wardic") collects, stores, uses, and protects data when interacting with Discord servers and users. By using the bot, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described below.

This bot does **not** collect sensitive personal data such as real names, email addresses, payment details, passwords, credit card information, or private messages outside of command usage.

## Data Collected

The bot may collect and store the following data strictly for functional and operational purposes:

* **User IDs** (Discord snowflakes)
* **Guild (Server) IDs**
* **Channel IDs**
* **Role IDs**
* **Message IDs** (only where required for features such as logging, moderation, or caching)
* **Usernames, display names, avatars, and profile banners** (as provided by Discord’s API)
* **Command usage data** (e.g. command name, timestamp, guild context)
* **Configuration data** set by server administrators (such as prefixes, settings, moderation rules, custom messages, or aliases)

No data is collected outside of what Discord explicitly provides through its API during normal bot operation.

## Data Not Collected

The bot explicitly does **not** collect, store, or process:

* Passwords
* Email addresses
* Phone numbers
* Payment or billing information
* Credit or debit card details
* Private message content unrelated to bot commands
* Any data not made available via Discord’s official API

## Purpose of Data Usage

Collected data is used only to:

* Provide core bot functionality
* Store server-specific configuration and preferences
* Enable moderation, logging, automation, or utility features
* Improve reliability and performance
* Prevent abuse or misuse of bot features

Data is never used for advertising, profiling, or tracking users across services.

## Data Storage

* Data is stored in a secure database controlled by the bot owner.
* Only the minimum amount of data required for features to function is retained.
* Data may be cached temporarily in memory to improve performance.

## Data Sharing

* Collected data is **never sold or shared** with third parties.
* Data is not transferred outside of the bot’s infrastructure.
* Data is not accessed by anyone other than the bot owner or authorized maintainers.

## Data Retention and Deletion

* Data is retained only as long as necessary for the bot’s features to function.
* When the bot is removed from a server, associated server data may be deleted automatically or during routine cleanups.
* Server administrators may request data removal related to their server.

## User Rights

While the bot operates solely within Discord’s ecosystem:

* Server owners and administrators may request clarification on stored data.
* Requests for data deletion or inspection will be handled on a best-effort basis.

## Policy Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of the bot after changes implies acceptance of the revised policy.

## Contact

For questions or concerns regarding these Terms, contact the bot owner through the [official support channel](https://www.discord.gg/FzgFmUb7T7).
